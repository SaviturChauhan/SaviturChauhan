👋 Hi there, I'm Savitur Chauhan!

💡 Aspiring Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Competitive Coder

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I craft robust full-stack applications and continuously explore the cutting edge of AI and software development. My journey is fueled by a passion for clean code and solving real-world challenges.

🚀 About Me

I am a B.Tech student in Communication and Computer Engineering at LNMIIT, Jaipur, specializing in building modern, scalable applications. My core expertise lies in the MERN stack, with a deep focus on integrating intelligent features using technologies like the Google Gemini API.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy tackling complex algorithms and contributing to collaborative environments, whether as a team lead or a technical mentor.

🎯 Core Focus Areas

💻 Featured Projects

Here are two applications that showcase my full-stack and AI integration skills:

1. Quick.AI – AI-Powered SaaS Application

A robust, commercial-grade MERN application featuring a suite of generative AI tools.

Key Features: Engineered AI tools (Article Generator, Image Manipulator, Résumé Analyzer) by integrating third-party APIs (Google Gemini, Clip Drop).

Architecture: Developed a scalable full-stack solution using the MERN stack, secured with Clerk for user authentication and subscription management.

Data: Utilized PostgreSQL for data integrity and Cloudinary for efficient image storage.

Repository: Check out the Quick.AI repo

2. Next Comm Q&A Platform

A specialized Q&A platform for wireless communication, built with modern web standards and AI features.

Key Features: Enabled seamless knowledge sharing with features like smart answer suggestions and duplicate-question detection using the Google Gemini API.

Technology: Full-stack architecture using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, styled with Tailwind CSS.

Security & UX: Designed a secure authentication system with JWT and Google OAuth. Includes gamified engagement (badges, leaderboard) and real-time notifications.
